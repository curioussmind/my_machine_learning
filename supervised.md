# supervised machine learning
We used this whenever we want to predict output from given input and we must have a pair of input-output. Our goal is to make accurate pred. from never before seen data. In supervised machine learning we need to build the training set. 

### Algorithms in supervised ML
There are two major types, they are **classification** and **regression**.
