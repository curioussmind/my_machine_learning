## Classifying iris method

A. importing required packages, models and functions needed
    - numpy
    - iris datasets
    - train_split_test func
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    - KNeighborsClassifier

B. Steps:
    1. import dataset and see what the data looks like
    2. see and analyse the features
    3. after we have clear understanding about the data we split the data into train and test data using test_split_func from sklearn
    Note: it will shuffles out data into 75%:25% (75 for training and 25 for test).
    4. inspecting the data by visualizing it 
    5. Build the model on the training set
    6. make prediction by calling predict method
    7. evaluating model
